# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with dynamic imports in Next.js 15's App Router.  The original `bug.js` shows the problem, where a dynamic import within a component leads to unexpected behavior or errors. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

**Problem:** When using dynamic imports within a component in the app directory of Next.js 15, it might not work correctly, resulting in runtime errors or incorrect rendering. This might be due to how the App Router handles code splitting and dynamic imports, especially under specific conditions.

**Solution:** The solution typically involves refactoring the code to avoid dynamic imports within the component or using a different approach to load the necessary modules.

This issue may be related to specific configurations of Next.js 15, the version of React used, or other dependencies, which makes it crucial to provide comprehensive information when reporting the bug.
